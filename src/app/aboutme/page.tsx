        <p>My name is Daryll Reillo. </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Ever since I was young, I&apos;ve always liked computers in general. I remember playing video games all day on my 16-bit Sega Mega Drive (a.k.a Sega
          Genesis) back when I was just seven. In high school, I remember overclocking my first PC until it got toast. Now, the tech has
          advanced so much, by leaps and bounds, that we can never bring back those low-tech days again.

          Anyway, I recently left my 10+ year-career as an SAP Functional Consultant so that I can pursue my dream career on web development. It took me a
          decade to take this risk. ðŸ˜Š
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Kudos to all of the people who believed and supported me - Giezzel, Alp, Merbs, Ralph, and all of you. I love you all.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Lastly, here&apos;s a gif of my dog playing.</p>
